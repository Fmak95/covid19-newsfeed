# covid19-news-summarizer
A web app that scrapes all relevant news about covid19.

The Web App can be found here: https://covid-19-news-feed.herokuapp.com/

## News Summarizer
I wanted to create a useful pipeline that pulls useful news information about the COVID-19 pandemic from various sources and puts them together in one easy to find place. This web app could be useful for individuals who want to keep updated regarding the situation of the pandemic. ElasticSearch backend was used so that advanced search queries could be used to find relevant information.

Currently pulling top news stories from Ontario focused news outlets such as: 
- **The Star**
- **CBC**
- **CTV**

## COVID Simulator
Created a model to simulate how the virus will pan out, modeled with a SEIR model. The model can be tuned based on certain virus parameters such as: Reproduction Number, Incubation Period, and Recovery Time and see how well the model reflects the real life data.
